# AirPlayServer - AirPlay Receiver for Windows

A high-performance AirPlay receiver for Windows with real-time video streaming and audio playback.

> **Note**: This is an updated version of [fingergit/airplay2-win](https://github.com/fingergit/airplay2-win)

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

1. **Download the latest release**: [AirPlay2-Win-x64.zip](https://github.com/xenos1337/AirPlayServer/releases/latest)
2. Extract the zip to a folder of your choice
3. **Install [Bonjour for Windows](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999)** if you don't have it already (required for device discovery). Installing iTunes also installs Bonjour.
4. Run **AirPlayServer.exe** — the server will warn you at startup if Bonjour is missing or not running

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later (x64)
- **Apple Bonjour for Windows** — required for mDNS device discovery. Install from [Apple's download page](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999) or install iTunes which bundles it. The server will warn you at startup if Bonjour is missing.

## Features

- **Full AirPlay Support**: Stream video, audio, and mirror your screen from iOS/macOS devices
- **Quality Presets**: Good Quality (30 FPS, Lanczos), Balanced (60 FPS, bilinear), Fast Speed (60 FPS, nearest-neighbor)
- **Smooth Playback**: Frame pacing with optimized rendering for stutter-free video
- **Low Latency**: Efficient YUV to RGB conversion with GPU texture upload
- **Resizable Window**: Live window resizing with instant feedback
- **Device Discovery**: Automatic mDNS/Bonjour service advertisement

## Usage

1. Launch AirPlayServer
2. The server automatically advertises itself on the network
3. Open Control Center on your iOS device (or AirPlay menu on macOS)
4. Select your Windows PC from the list of available AirPlay devices
5. Start streaming!

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **H** | Toggle overlay UI |
| **F** / **Double-click** | Toggle fullscreen |
| **F1** | Toggle performance graphs |
| Mouse movement | Shows cursor (auto-hides after 5s) |

### Quality Presets

Changeable in real-time from the home screen or overlay:

| Preset | FPS | Scaling | Use Case |
|--------|-----|---------|----------|
| Good Quality | 30 | Lanczos | Best image quality |
| Balanced | 60 | Bilinear | Default, smooth + sharp |
| Fast Speed | 60 | Nearest-neighbor | Lowest latency |

## Troubleshooting

### Device not appearing on iPhone/iPad/Mac

- Ensure **Bonjour for Windows** is installed and the "Bonjour Service" is running (`services.msc`)
- Both devices must be on the **same Wi-Fi network and subnet**
- Check **Windows Firewall** — allow AirPlayServer through for Private networks

### Connects but no video/audio

- If Windows is in a VM, use **bridged networking** (not NAT)
- Verify no VPN or proxy is interfering with the connection

## Building from Source

Requires Visual Studio 2022 (v143 toolset) and Windows 10 SDK.

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xenos1337/AirPlayServer.git
   ```
2. Open `AirPlay.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Right-click **AirPlayServer** in Solution Explorer → "Set as Startup Project"
4. Build with `Ctrl+B`, run with `F5`

Output: `x64\Debug\AirPlayServer.exe`
